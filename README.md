A package of modules that include Data Science helper functions 

This is my first package, and it includes some useful and general-purpose reusuable code.  
The module Class Helper Functions (class_helper_functions) includes code written to add another layer of functionality to DataFrames data and Arrays by creating class object DataFrameHelper and includes a bonus function for dealing with a Series of addresses. 

***Includes methods for DataFrameHelper class:***
   
   ```null_count       - Check a DataFrame for null values and returns the number of missing valuse```
   
   ```train_test_split - Create a train/test split function for a data frame that returns both the
                         training and test sets.  'frac' refers to the percent of data you would
                         like to set aside for training```
